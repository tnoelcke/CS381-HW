2/2/2018 CS 381 notes.

Today in class we are going over different solutions to the HW and quiz problems.

1a. Type error b. type error. Correct!
Type of a data consructor is a fuction that takes a data type ane retunrs a different data type.
c.Value->Bool d. Int -> Value. Pretty sure I got these correct.

data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing.
Data consructors build structured values so we can undo the consruction using pattern matching.
A. Write a haskell value of type Tree that represents a tree.

Node 4 (Node 3 (Node 2 Nil Nil) Nil)
	(Node 5 Nil Nil)

I also got this one correct. I must have missed something in the last problem.
This is similar to midterm question. However it will be more compoicated.

b. Write a function that counds the number of node values in a tree.
nils:: Tree -> Int
nils Nil = 1
nils (Node _ l r) = nils l + nils r

My fuction was much more complicated. I didn't realize you could patern match on Nils and still have it be considered a tree.
I should probably look at the data constructor and make sure that Nil is a valid tree.

Tree = Node | Nil

pratice problem 15. from piazza.
15 map (add 3) . map ok

map ok 
map a -> b -> [a] -> [b]

map ok = [int] -> [result] is the type.

map (add 3)
(add 3) result -> result

map add (3) = [result] -> [result] 
f * g, gout  = fin
fin = [result]
gout = [result]

so this is from [Result] -> [Result]
