What is naming?

Most languages provide a way to name and reuse stuff.

Declaration introduce a new name  int x;
binding associate a name with a thing x = 5;
reference use the name to stat for the bound thing. x = x + 1

We need to make sure we make a recognize Reference vs Declaration.

let x = slow 42
in x + x + x
This example demonstrates Declaration in let x.
Shows binding in slow 42 and reference in x + x + x and in slow 42.


What are type names?
Declaration
type Radius = Float 
Declaration                 Reference.
data Shape = Circle Radius

Shape and Radius are bound to the types on the right hand side.

area r = pi * r * r

r is a declaration of new parameter r
area is being bound in this definition.
r is not being bound in the function it self but in the function call.

We will be asked to distinguish between declaration and reference.

type Env = Name -> Thing
Envoirnment: a mapping from names to things

Naming concepts
Declaration add a new name to the Env
Binding set the thing associated with a name
reference get the thing assocaiated with a name.

immutables vars (Haskell) Env -> Val evaluating the value on the environment cannot change the environment.
mutables vars (C java python) Env -> (Env, Val) This can change the environment.
